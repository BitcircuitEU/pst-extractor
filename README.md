# pst-extractor
Extract objects from MS Outlook/Exchange PST files.

This is based off the code from https://github.com/rjohnsondev/java-libpst.  Thanks to Richard Johnson and Orin Eman.

A spec from Microsoft on the PST file format is at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff385210(v=office.12).aspx. 

Start with index.ts for sample code to walk the PST and print out the folder structure.
