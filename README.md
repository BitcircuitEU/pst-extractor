# pst-extractor
Extract objects from MS Outlook/Exchange PST files.

This is based off the code from https://github.com/rjohnsondev/java-libpst.  Thanks to Richard Johnson and Orin Eman.

A spec from Microsoft on the PST file format is at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff385210(v=office.12).aspx. 

Start with index.ts for sample code to walk the PST and print out the folder structure to the console.  Also, most of the major objects have Mocha test specs which show how the object attributes can be accessed.
